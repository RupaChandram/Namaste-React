### Class Summary Chapter - 02 Igniting React App (31/12/2022)

* Chapter-02 was about creating production-ready react app from scratch without using create-react-app.
* Production-ready app on the second day of a course ? sounds interesting right !!? 
* The concept of bundlers (Parcel) was explained in detail. 
* We all assume React is the one superpower that makes the application faster, though it is partially right, the major credit goes to the other packages/helper utilities (Bundler) for speeding up the application, optimizing the code, improving the performance and lots more. Find the other interesting powerful featured of bundler in class notes.
* One line about this chapter : As Akshay says Parcel is a BEAST.
* If you are interested in learning other chapters of this series, please browse through the my repositories. Notes in md file.
