## Chapter - 08 (Let's get classy)

- This chapter is all about class based component and life cycle of component.
- Class based component is very important for interviews.
- Although we have to use functional based components for upcoming projects, it's compulsory to know about class based component because many companies can have older projects so we need to aware of that. It will make you a better developer because through this, you will get to know that what the pholosophy was when react developed
##### Remember adapt coding practice. Know about CBC but use FBC.

### Topics that are covered:
- Quick Test 
- Children of Children in routing
- Class Based Component
- extends
- props in CBC and FBC
- state variable in CBC and FBC
- Two states in CBC and FBC
- setState in CBC and FBC
- Multiple setState
- Why is React so popular?
- Sequence of excution in CBC for render and contructor
- componentDidMount()
- Function to call the API in CBC and FBC
- Execution sequence of render, constructor, componentDidMount() in CBC when there is a parent and a child
- Execution sequence of a parent with 2 children
- Component Life cycle
- Methods of component life cycle
- In componentDidMount(), I am calling API and after API call, I am simply doing console.log() then what would be the first execution? API call or console.log()?
- Execution sequence with componentDidUpdate()
- use of componentWillUnmount
- How would you write the below code in CBC for componentDidUpdate

### Coding
