## Chapter 1 - Inception (24/12/2022)

* Chapter-01 (Inception) was the first session of the Namaste React Live course. The whole class was excited about the beginning of a great course.
We started learning react from scratch. 

* Environment setup was clearly explained. Started with creating a simple Hello world program .

* First, using only html, then we tried to implement the same through javascript. Finally, we created a simple hello world program using React.

* Everything was done without installing any package. Unlike other courses which starts with create-react-app as first session, we tried writing the react code from zero.

* It was a true inception session for tranforming from ZERO to HERO in React.
